## ðŸ’» About Me
I'm currently a **2nd-year BTech student in Computer Science Engineering** with a passion for learning and building web-based applications. I have hands-on experience with **C language**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **MySQL**, and Iâ€™m constantly expanding my knowledge in web development and programming.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively learning more about front-end technologies to enhance my skills and contribute to meaningful projects. I enjoy problem-solving and working on collaborative projects, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow in the tech field.
